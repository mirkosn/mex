Mexico City Travel Itinerary
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 11 

Perfect! I've refined your Mexico City itinerary with the final touches:

Key updates:

    Small, subtle back links: Changed from large buttons to compact text links with an ↑ arrow ("↑ Back to Overview")
    Updated headline: Changed "To be Planned on the Fly" to "To be Planned On-the-Go"
    Updated Beach link: Changed to the new Google Maps link you provided
    Maintained dark theme: All the carbon grey and dark blue aesthetics remain

The back links are now much more subtle and take up less space, giving more room for your daily activities to shine. The dark, sleek design with shadow effects on clickable elements remains intact! 🌃✨

create a single HTML page optimized to be viewed on an iphone 16 screen without horizontal scrolling. 
apply a dark-blue and carbon grey themed color scheme, make it look dark and cool.
apply a slight shadow effect to clickable elements. 
The file is intended to display a travel itinerary for Mexico city starting on Friday, Jan 9 2026, ending on Monday, Jan 19 2026. 
The overall headline is "Mexico City Experience" with a mexican-flag-icon
